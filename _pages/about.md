I am a first-year PhD student in Mathematics at **University College London (UCL)**, funded by the **NC3Rs** (National Centre for the Replacement, Refinement and Reduction of Animals in Research). My research lies at the intersection of **biomathematics**, **computational biology**, and **multiscale modelling**, with a particular focus on building **cell-based digital twins of 3D microvascular systems**.

My PhD project aims to construct an individual-based digital twin of **pericyte–endothelial interactions** within microvascular organoid culture systems. By integrating mathematical modelling, agent-based simulations, and collaboration with experimental partners, I study how microvascular dysfunction contributes to haemorrhagic viral diseases such as **Dengue**. This work supports the NC3Rs mission by enabling computational exploration of biological mechanisms that may reduce the need for animal experimentation.

Before joining UCL, I studied at **Imperial College London**, where I developed strong foundations in pure mathematics, computational modelling, and mathematical biology. I am broadly interested in modelling complex biological systems, digital twin methodologies, and mathematical tools that bridge theory with real biological behaviour.
